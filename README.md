## 🔍 What Does It Do?

The application is designed to **analyze two questions** and determine whether they are **duplicates** of each other using **textual similarity models**.

It includes 🚀:

* ✨ **Robust NLP Techniques** to measure semantic similarity.
* 🎤 **Voice Input Integration** — Ask questions by speaking instead of typing!
* 🖥️ **User-Friendly Interface** — Built for seamless interaction and accessibility.

## 💻 How It Works

### Text Processing

* Text is preprocessed:

  * Lowercased
  * Punctuation removal
  * Stopwords removal
  * Tokenization
* Text vectors are generated using **TF-IDF**.

### Similarity Calculation

* **Cosine Similarity** is computed between the two question vectors.
* If similarity score exceeds a threshold → Questions are marked **Duplicate** ✅.

### Voice Input Feature

* **SpeechRecognition** library captures audio from the user.
* Audio is transcribed into text and directly analyzed for duplication check.

---

## 🎯 Results

* ✅ Accurately identifies **duplicate** vs **non-duplicate** question pairs.
* ✅ Provides flexibility to **input text manually** or **use voice input** for asking questions.
* ✅ **Real-time predictions** with clear labeling of results.

## 📈 Why This Project Matters

Detecting duplicate questions is crucial in many real-world applications like:

* 🛠️ **Online Forums** (e.g., Stack Overflow, Quora)
* 🧠 **Knowledge Management Systems**
* 📚 **Educational Platforms** and FAQs
* 🔍 **Search Engines Optimization**

This project demonstrates how **NLP** combined with **interactive technologies** can create smart systems to enhance user experiences and information retrieval.
